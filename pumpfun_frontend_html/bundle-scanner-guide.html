    <h2>What is a "bundle"?</h2>
    <p>
        If you're new here, bundling is an action that token developers use to control large amounts of their supply. This is common nowadays to ensure that bad actors (rogue whales or snipers) don't ruin the momentum of a token significantly. 
        The problem with bundles stems from the team/dev being THE bad actor and @PumpkinDetective is designed to assist your game.<br>
    </p>
    <h2>Bundling Origins</h2>
    <p>Before pump.fun, the term bundling meant "putting multiple transaction instructions in one transaction". In simple terms, devs could use multiple wallets to buy the same coin in the same exact transaction. This was commonly done in the same transaction where the LP was deployed. It was understandable as teams didn't want snipers to catch any destructive amount of the supply on launch, so they caught that supply themselves. Essentially, tokens would be deployed AND bought up in the same transaction. With time, users figured out these bundles can easily be detected by just looking at the first few transactions. </p>
    <h2>üíä Pump.fun Bundling History</h2>
    <p>When pump.fun first launched, devs used the same tactic as bundling originally. When creating a token you're prompted with how much SOL you want to buy. This in of itself is a "bundle" that's built in with pump.fun. Your buy transaction (as a dev) is bundled with the token creation and launch. This was also easily detectable and easy to check with the UI directly. 
    To gain more leverage, teams started adding more and more wallets into that initial creation transaction. That's where it initially started. This ensured that no snipers bought and gave the teams a large amount of supply. However, with time trading terminals and bots adapted to this and easily showed these sorts of bundles extremely easily. It also became even harder to do it after pump.fun implemented built in bubblemap support.</p>       
    <h2>ü§î So, what changed?</h2>
    <p>The newest way to bypass these checks was to do an orchestrated mass snipe rather than a traditional bundle. We will use the term bundle from here on out to keep it simple. The way it works is that a slot (or a block) gets queued for multiple buys at once. All the buys are then executed in separate transactions but within the same 0.4 seconds or so. Pump.fun has built in warnings for this, but they're not very detailed and it's hard to group when there's a lot of other transactions. Here's what it looks like:</p>
    <img src="images/bundle-image.png" class="">
    <p>The warning signs are the ‚ö†Ô∏è on the right</p>
    <p>This means all 3 buy transactions were in the same exact slot with only a few milliseconds apart. These buys are usually orchestrated by the team and the chances of this occurring are very low BUT possible (more on that later).
        With pump.fun's UI and a bunch of other transactions flowing in, this can be a bit hard to distinguish from a quick look, this is where Pumpkin Detective comes in.
        </p>
    <h2>üö® Pumpkin's Part</h2>
    <p>Pumpkin provides detailed information about tokens, including market cap, developer wallet address, and links to token charts.
        It also isplays alerts and updates for tokens that match the filtering criteria, which identifies potentially safer or more promising tokens.
    </p>
    <h2> ‚ö†Ô∏è Considerations</h2>
    <p>Our bundle checker is by no means perfect. There are exceptions to all trading methods, and we are here to offer a specific filter to help you evaluate and filter tokens based on safety criteria.</p>
